# Chart Formatting Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Decimal Display Problem**: Charts were showing ".0" decimals (e.g., "50.0", "150.0") despite using `.0f` format
2. **Waveform Data Loss**: Aggressive rounding and averaging was destroying waveform patterns, making them appear as straight lines
3. **Data Aggregation Issues**: Multiple data points were being collapsed into single points, causing charts to appear empty or incorrect

## Root Cause Analysis

The previous implementation was:

- Rounding both X and Y values to integers before plotting
- Aggressively averaging duplicate X values after rounding
- Using `.0f` formatting which still shows ".0" for integers
- Applying the same logic to all chart types regardless of their nature

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smart Chart Type-Specific Processing

**Waveforms (Time Series)**:

- ✅ **Preserve original data** - No rounding of actual data values
- ✅ **Keep waveform shape intact** - No aggregation that destroys temporal patterns
- ✅ **Clean display formatting** - Use `tickformat='d'` for axes

**Spectrum Charts (Bar Charts)**:

- ✅ **Intelligent frequency binning** - Round X to meaningful bins
- ✅ **Proper aggregation** - Sum magnitudes for same frequency/order (not average)
- ✅ **Reasonable precision** - Keep Y precision at 1 decimal place for accuracy

**Scatter Plots**:

- ✅ **Preserve relationships** - No aggressive rounding that destroys correlations
- ✅ **Clean axis display** - Use `tickformat='g'` for automatic best representation

### 2. Proper Axis Formatting

**Before:**

```python
fig.update_xaxes(tickformat='.0f')  # Shows "50.0"
fig.update_yaxes(tickformat='.0f')  # Shows "50.0"
```

**After:**

```python
fig.update_xaxes(tickformat='d')    # Shows "50" (integers only)
fig.update_yaxes(tickformat='g')    # Shows "50" or "50.5" (best representation)
```

### 3. Aggregation Strategy by Chart Type

**Waveforms**: No aggregation - preserve temporal data integrity
**Spectrums**: Sum values for same frequency/order bins (physically meaningful)
**Scatter**: Minimal aggregation - preserve data relationships

## File Changes Made

### `chart_generator.py`

- **Waveforms**: Removed data rounding, preserved original values, fixed axis formatting
- **Spectrum Hz/Order**: Smart frequency binning with sum aggregation, clean integer labels
- **Generic/Scatter**: Preserved data relationships, minimal processing
- **All charts**: Updated to use `'d'` and `'g'` tick formats instead of `.0f`

### `report_generator.py`

- Updated chart optimization for reports to use proper integer formatting
- Changed `tickformat='.0f'` to `tickformat='d'` for X-axes
- Changed to `tickformat='g'` for Y-axes for automatic best representation

## Expected Results

1. ✅ **No more ".0" decimals** - Axes show clean integers (50, 100, 150)
2. ✅ **Waveforms display correctly** - Temporal patterns preserved and visible
3. ✅ **Spectrum charts accurate** - Proper frequency/order bins with correct magnitudes
4. ✅ **Professional reports** - Clean integer display optimized for PDF printing
5. ✅ **Performance maintained** - Smart sampling and processing still in place

## Technical Details

### Plotly Tick Formats Used

- `'d'`: Integer format without decimals (50, 100, 150)
- `'g'`: General format - automatically chooses best representation
- Removed `'.0f'`: Fixed-point format that shows unwanted ".0"

### Aggregation Functions

- **Waveforms**: None (preserve all data points)
- **Spectrums**: `groupby().sum()` - physically meaningful for frequency/order data
- **Scatter**: Minimal processing to preserve correlations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Waveforms show proper wave patterns (not straight lines)
- [ ] Spectrum charts show correct frequency/order bins
- [ ] Axes display clean integers without ".0"
- [ ] Reports generate with proper formatting
- [ ] PDF conversion produces professional results
- [ ] Performance remains optimal for large datasets
